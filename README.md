# odin-recipes
This project will have a main page that links to three different recipes from pop culture.
This includes Ratatouille, Food Wars, and Cowboy Bebop.
This project will utilize everything I have learned about HTML, Git, and using the terminal
I will be inserting images into the recipe pages, and using lists and ordered lists for the actual recipe itself.
