        <p>In the show <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, two bounty hunters, Spike Spiegel and Jet Black, are living paycheck to paycheck.
            One day, Jet cooks them a meal that he calls <strong>Bell peppers and beef</strong>. Spike notices that there is no
            beef in the meal, and that Jet should stop calling it that. Jet then finds out that he used a packet of mushrooms instead of beef.
